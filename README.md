Computer Security Project - Java Implementation of Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm

This is Computer Security Project I did for My Computer Security Class. This is a Java Implementation of Digital Signature using Elliptic Curves (EC) which is growing in its popularity because of it's provable security through intractibility and efficiency compared to popular assymetric cryptographic options like RSA.

This project implements Java BigInteger Library and uses NIST Recommended Curve P-192 as described in P182-6. I have built the EC architecture and framework atop these library and Curve.

In its current form, this project does not function as it is intended to. Any suggestion is appreciated.
